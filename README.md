## Background
Every year, Chicago alderpersons get $1.5 million to spend at their discretion on capital improvements on their ward. Some alderpersons do this through a **participatory budgeting** (PB) process, where residents can propose projects and vote to determine which ones receive funding.

This project has two goals:
1. **Assist UIC's Great Cities Institute in performing data analysis to determine the effectiveness of the current PB process.**
2. **Collect data and create tools to incorporate more urban planning and community engagement into the PB process.** See [problems with the current PB process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CA4asPvf4NSn9hnGfhxsvhL78I6Dgi45OHBlkLVlgKA/edit?usp=sharing).
