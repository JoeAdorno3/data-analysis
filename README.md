# Chicago Participatory Urbanism

Check out the GitHub issues for things to work on.

## Getting Started/Installing the Repo
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run the following command in the terminal:
```
pip install .
```

### PDF data extraction

You can use the `chicago_participatory_urbanism\extract_text_from_pdf.py` script to extract data from the ward spending reports on the [Chicago Capital Improvement Archive](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/obm/provdrs/cap_improve/svcs/cip-archive.html). This script is currently designed for the 2019-2022 reports format. It needs to be modified to extract data from earlier formats.

### Geocoding

Run the `src\ward_spending_geocoding_script.py` to geocode ward spending data.


## Background
Every year, Chicago alderpersons get $1.5 million to spend at their discretion on capital improvements on their ward. Some alderpersons do this through a **participatory budgeting** (PB) process, where residents can propose projects and vote to determine which ones receive funding.   

[Chicago Participatory Budgeting Overview](https://www.participatepbchicago.org/pages/pbgeneralinfo)

This project has two goals:
1. **Assist UIC's Great Cities Institute in performing data analysis to determine the effectiveness of the current PB process.**
2. **Collect data and create tools to incorporate more urban planning and community engagement into the PB process.** See [problems with the current PB process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CA4asPvf4NSn9hnGfhxsvhL78I6Dgi45OHBlkLVlgKA/edit?usp=sharing).
